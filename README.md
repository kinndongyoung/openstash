### What?
It's an inventory and weapons system that aims to be as flexible as possible. I am developing this in tandem with my Deus Ex-based game project [The Vongott Chronicles](http://jeppezapp.com/vongott/)

### Why?
A large percentage of all games use inventory systems in some shape or another, and coding it every time is a drag, because so much of the backend is (or could be) completely similar to all others. This is a quick and stable solution for skipping that step and focusing on the GUI.
